    desc: 'This project began as a personal initiative by myself to update the UX and UI of our admin platform. The current admin site had UI that was created by several disconnected teams, and was not up to the standards that I wanted to provide to our customers. My goal was to streamline the UX, pulling useful information straight to the home page to be seen at a glance. The dashboard were designed with the intention that each user could customize their home page to show data that is relevant to them. I designed this dashboard with Dark Mode in mind, utilizing an 8px grid, and a responsive tiled layout. Checkout the GitHub link below to see how I made this site. Only the Home page is available in this demo.',

  { title: 'Design System Foundation',
    desc: 'Driven by the need to quickly jump into new projects, I created this foundational system of UI components called Design System Foundation. The foundations of the system are comprised of colors, typography, and icons. I used these foundations to create a small library of flexible UI symbols/components. These components can be used to quickly create hi-fi wireframes and mockups. I also coded this system in React as a framework for this website and future projects.',

  { title: 'Self Checkout 2020',
    desc: 'Having created self checkout products since 2014, I wanted to use everything I had learned to create one of the most clean and intuitive self checkout platforms ever. Self Checkout is often over-complicated, with too many options for users presented in an obtuse way. With Self Checkout 2020, the layout and hierarchy is presented in a logical and orderly way, based around the thought process of an average user. I revisited feedback from our users to organize the UX in a familiar way by ordering the elements around what users objectives were. The workflow was simplified to add items, then pay; with no fluff in-between. I also addressed the needs of our clients by adding long desired features such as full-screen video ads, persistent ad space, featured products, and reachable intuitive buttons. My goal was to lead the users on a journey through sparse use of colors as a guide for completing their goals with no filler. Myself and another engineer fully coded this project in less than a month, with thorough UI documentation in Storybook for other developers to use when working on this project.',

    desc: 'I became involved in this project once developers had established their own style, which had taken direction inspiration from other apps such as Outlook, Starbucks, and Whole Foods. My first task was to establish a color template in order to be able to re-skin this app for other clients. Then I recreated what had already been created in Sketch, and established a reusable library of UI symbols that I could then push into a more unique a distinctive direction that also united the look-and-feel of all of their other products. For each of the unique workflow requirements, I worked with Product Managers on getting the primary workflows correct using Overflow, then I created UI in Sketch, and created clickable prototypes in Invision. I also contributed to the front-end development by creating reusable component. This product was a challenge because of the diverse nature of its features; users could self-checkout with the camera, or order preppared food ahead of time, or connect to bluetooth devices such as vending machines to dispense items, and much more.',

  { title: '365 Design System',
    desc: 'At 365 the challenge was to create a unified template-driven look and feel across several point-of-sale platforms. To accomplish this, I established a standard of colors, typography, and components in Sketch to be used in all future designs. Working with a developer, we created a React library of reusable UI with styled-components. These components were easy to template by connecting them to styled-systems. My goal was to make it super-easy for any developer to create UI that is consistant. We used Storybook to document all the props for each component. This system ended up greatly increasing the speed at which we could create interfaces, and allowed me to create rapid prototypes fast.',
